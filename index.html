                <p> This grilled chicken salad is tender marinated chicken that’s grilled to perfection then served over lettuce with bacon, avocado, corn, blue cheese and tomatoes. A hearty salad that’s packed with flavor and also happens to be full of nutrition.</p>

                <p> 7 layer dip is one of the best party appetizers ever. Layers of fresh salsa, refried beans, guacamole, and cheddar cheese.</p>

                <p> This Tex Mex chicken and zucchini is a variation of my black bean quinoa casserole with added chicken for a protein boost and quinoa replaced by zucchini. Everything is cooked within 30 minutes, right in one pan.</p>
